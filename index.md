## Server 161 Rules of Engagement (RoE)
###revised on the 10th April 2020:

A) Survey Ships are protected up to the limit of their protected cargo as defined by the game.

Situations when the destruction of a survey ship is authorized :

1. Overcargo: The protected cargo limit of the ship is exceeded.

2. Zero node: The ship is sitting idle on a depleted mine (attackers are required to send a message 2 minutes beforehand to explain the reason of the attack and to make a screenshot of the mine showing 0. The defender is allowed to reset the mine during the given 2mins and so avoid attack). 

3. Raids: When participating in a base raid.

4. Wars: No RoE applies during a war (it must be declared officially to the Council). 

5. Augment Space: the Botany Bay is the only survey ship authorized in Augment territory. Other mining survey ships will not be protected by the RoE and can be destroyed.

B) RoE only applies to alliances who adhere to the RoE. Pirates are not protected by the RoE.

C) Any ship participating in an “Armada” is not to be attacked.

D) Every other ship is NOT protected.

If a ship is unlawfully killed, the attacker is contacted and asked why, if he does not answer within 5 minutes, (in the case of EMK) the mine may be retrieved. 

If these rules are violated, try to resolve it with the offender. If the dispute cannot be resolved, report it to your alliance's Diplomat, Commodore or Admiral - who should then post relevant reports in #roe-alliance-to-alliance. Repeated offences should be posted in #roe-alliance-to-council for review by the council.
